# Welcome

This website is documenting the efforts around the **Interchain Standards for Non-Fungible Tokens and Metadata**.

**Why are we tackling Metadata and NFTs standardization together?**

Metadata is what makes an NFT valuable, it is the glue between the token and the asset it represents. Improving both standards will help NFTs reach their full potential faster.

**Why do we want these standards to be blockchain agnostic and interoperable?**

This Working Group believes in a future with many blockchains interoperating with one another, that includes NFTs going from one chain to another. By building common standards together we can make this happen faster.

**Who is behind this initiative?**

This open collaboration was initiated by the [Interchain Foundation](https://interchain.io/) and is facilitated by [ixo (The Internet of Impact)](https://ixo.world/) together with [Persistence One (Protocol Powering Institutional DeFi)](https://persistence.one/). ðŸ‘‰ [Read the official announcement on the ICF blog](https://blog.cosmos.network/interchain-standards-for-non-fungible-tokens-and-metadata-fbf90375c38b)
