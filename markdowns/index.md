# Welcome

This website is documenting the efforts around the **Interchain Standards for Non-Fungible Tokens and Metadata**. 

Why are we tackling Metadata and NFTs standardization together? \
Metadata is what makes an NFT valuable, it is the glue between the token and the asset it represents. Improving both standards will help NFTs reach their full potential faster.

Why do we want these standards to be blockchain agnostic and interoperable? \
This Working Group believes in a future with many blockchains interoperating with one another, that includes NFTs going from one chain to another. By building common standards together we can make this happen faster.

This open collaboration was initiated by the [Interchain Foundation](https://interchain.io/) and is facilitated by [ixo (The Internet of Impact)](https://ixo.world/) together with [Persistence One (Protocol Powering Institutional DeFi)](https://persistence.one/).
