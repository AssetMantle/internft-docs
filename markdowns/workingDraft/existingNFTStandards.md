| Type    | Network |  Standard / Name   |   Compatibility   |   Example Instance    |   Purpose / Comments    |   Comments  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| Non-Fugible Token Standard    | Ethereum |  [ERC721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721){:target="_blank"}    |    |   Cryptokitties    |   Standard allowing for tokens to be distinguished from each other, granting the ability to attach tokens to different types of assets and verify their ownership on the blockchain. Put simply, ERC721 is the non-fungible token standard, allowing us to create and exchange NFTs.    |     |
| Multi Token Standard    | Ethereum |  [ERC-1155](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1155){:target="_blank"}    |   ERC-721   |   Weapons and Coins in a Game    |   Created by the team at Enjin, this standard allows for both fungible and non-fungible items in the same smart contract. In doing so, ERC-1155 reduces the amount of data required, creating smoother deployments and requiring a lot less network power.    |     |
| Delegated Non-Fungible Token Standard    | Ethereum |  [ERC-994](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/994){:target="_blank"}   |       |   Land registery NFT updated/notified whenever any of its "delegated NFT" change owners    |   ERC-994 has created a system where DNFT’s can identify an area or zone (let’s say the suburb you live in), and can then delegate NFT’s to represent individual houses or parcels of land. In this way, ownership of property can be tokenised whilst also providing a way to update land registries, and legally verify their sale.    |     |
