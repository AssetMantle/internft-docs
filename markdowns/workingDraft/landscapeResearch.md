## Existing Standards for NFTs

The existing standards for NFTs is essentially divided in two: the Ethereum based standards versus the rest.

Ethereum has numerious advanced standards architected to various use-cases such as ERC721, ERC-1155 and ERC-994. Whereas other blockchains only have one or two standards at best. 

The Ethereum NFT standards have a lot traction and are in real use whereas the other standards are only nascent and starting to be used.

## Existing Standards for Metadata

This field is still nascent with only a few standards in place. OpenSea was the first to establish one, for Ethereum. And recently (October 2020), Tezos received a proposal for Metadata Standard.
